# node-pdf-zip
Converting a matrix of hospitals and indicators to PDF and zipping up for download. This is basically a demo of the PDF capabilities of Puppeteer and the zipping capabilities of another library called 'zip-dir'. Designed as a step along the way for a more robust project, but was a nice stand-alone script to share in a repo.
